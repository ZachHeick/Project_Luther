# Project Luther: Predicting Movie Ratings by Roger Ebert
### Project 2 of Metis Data Science Bootcamp  

The second project at Metis focused on using web scraping techniques and building a linear regression model to learn more about a topic of our choice and see if we could predict certain outcomes. For this project, I wanted to analyze how Roger Ebert reviewed and rated movies and asked the question, *Can* *we* *predict* *how* *Roger* *Ebert* *would* *rate* *movies* *if* *he* *were* *alive* *today*?
