# Project Luther: Predicting Movie Ratings by Roger Ebert
### Project 2 of Metis Data Science Bootcamp  

From entertaining B-movies to Hollywood summer blockbusters, I've always enjoyed watching and discussing movies with friends, breaking down the good, the bad, and the ugly. When it comes to critiquing movies professionally, no one had a more talked about review than Roger Ebert. The second project at Metis focused on using web scraping techniques and building a linear regression model to learn more about a topic of our choice and see if we could predict certain outcomes. For this project, I wanted to analyze how Ebert reviewed and rated movies and asked the question, *Can* *we* *predict* *how* *Roger* *Ebert* *would* *rate* *movies* *if* *he* *were* *alive* *today*?
